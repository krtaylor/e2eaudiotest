What is it:
===========
This program is a simple test for testing the audio device on a linux host.
The application, testfreq, will test the audio device by playing a sine wave
at A440 and then sampling the input for that frequency - input is coupled to
output with a cable.


To build:
=========

first install libasound2-dev and libfftw3-dev

then run make

make clean will tidy up


To run the test:
================

use a cable to connect the input jack to the output jack (line out to mic in)

adjust mixer settings for your device

run with:  ./e2eaudiotest.sh
